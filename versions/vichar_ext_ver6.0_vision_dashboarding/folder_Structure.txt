How to Start a New Chat
There are two main ways to interact with the extension:

Sidebar Analysis (Recommended):

Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar
Select "Open Analysis Sidebar"
A sidebar will appear on the right side of the chess website
Click "Capture Current Position" in the sidebar
Ask questions about the position in the text area


New Tab Analysis:

Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar
Select "Capture & Open in New Tab"
A new tab will open with the captured position
Ask questions about the position in this new tab



Both methods allow you to capture chess positions and analyze them by asking questions.
Development Notes

The extension works on both Lichess.org and Chess.com
When making changes, reload the extension in Chrome's extension manager
After reloading, refresh the chess website to load the updated content script
For best results with the sidebar, always refresh the chess page after installing or updating the extension

Would you like me to provide more details on any specific part of the extension?
